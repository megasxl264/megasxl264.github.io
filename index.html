I am new to the industry, and I am starting this blog mostly as a learning
platform for myself - since the best way to learn and prove your knowledge is to
present the topic at hand in a way that is easily digestible for others. In this
blog. I will focus on the foundational skills that it takes to get a job in the
IT or Programming industry. It will include topics from Front End Development,
Back End Development, Networking, Security, Cloud, Operating System Concepts
(CLI, VMs, Containers etc.), Linux, and useful Dev Tools/Tips. So, as I learn
you learn! Expect updates weekly on Tuesdays and Saturdays!
